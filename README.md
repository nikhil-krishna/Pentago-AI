# Pentago-AI

To play the game, just evaluate the PentagoCode notebook in Mathematica. Then evaluate the PentagoUICode notebook to see a screen pop up allowing you to play. Ensure that every file in this repository is in the same directory on your system.

Known bugs: when clicking the "Hint" button in 1 player mode, it may take a while for the AI to make the move; the screen itself may also require a click from the player after the hint move is played.
